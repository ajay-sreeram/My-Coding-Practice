James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language 
project  in  June  1991.[15]  Java  was  originally  designed  for  interactive
television,  but  it  was  too  advanced  for  the  digital  cable television in
dustry  at  the  time.[16]  The  language  was  initially  called  Oak after an
oak  tree  that  stood  outside  Gosling's  office.  Later  the  project went by
  the  name  Green  and  was  finally  renamed  Java,  from Java coffee,[17] sai
d to be consumed in large quantities by the language's creators
