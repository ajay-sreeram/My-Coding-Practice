HOW TO PLAY!
********************
The Shabaaz will perform magic and real mindreading
Nobody escapes from the Shabaaz's mind.
Follow instructions ...

Think of any number between 10 and 99.
Add both digits together.For example,23 equals 5.
Now subtract the total(i.e 5) from your original choice (i.e 23) 
When you get the total,look up the number on Shabaaz's chart for its corresponding symbol or alphabet. 
and focus on it(Symbol or alphabet)..atleast 10 seconds....concentrate...
after finishing click the SHOW .you will beleive Shabaaz can see you...  


Dont play with shabaaz chart by dragging it..its magical,its contents gets dissappeared...
